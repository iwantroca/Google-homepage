# Google-homepage Clone
This is an unofficial rebuild of generic Google Search page using the **HTML** and **CSS**.

Live Preview of the project is [here](https://iwantroca.github.io/Google-homepage/). 

### Overview
- This Project just shares the basic frontend with original google page and is not exactly similar.
- It is responsive so will still look good on different aspect ratios.
- It is built using HTML5 semantics and CSS3 flexbox.

### Notes
- This is my first completed project.
- Working on this project made me familiar with the efficient usage of HTML and CSS.
